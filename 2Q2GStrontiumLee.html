  <p>Here is my schedule for the day! I chose this picture of me and my friend, because it reminds me of the struggle both of us went through when the two of us were studying for the second day of periodical exams...and we were stuck fixating on our chemistry grades! As for the video, Burnout by Sugarfree is one of my favourite songs. I love the beat, and I could never get tired of it. The table I've embedded is based on the song I Have Forgiven Jesus by Morrisey which can really describe how tiring the week can be.
